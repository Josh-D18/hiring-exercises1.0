# Welcome Hiring Exercises

This repository contains a set of exercises you can use to demonstrate your skills and abilities. These are **NOT** *coding exercises*. The goal of these exercises is to give you a medium for demonstrating how you would break down a set of user stories and requirements into something akin to a POC/spike. There is no grading or scoring, nor is it pass-fail, rather these are meant to serve a sample of your reductive thought processes as an engineer.


## Instructions

1. Choose an exercise directory that matches your primary domain. This is the area in which you feel the most comfortable and have the higest degree of mastery
    * [frontend](frontend/instructions.md)
    * [backend](backend/instructions.md)
    * [data](data/instructions.md)
    * [devops](devops/instructions.md)


2. Read the `instructions.md` file in the matching directory. Be sure to read the instructions carefully and ask any clarifying questions either via [Github issues](https://github.com/pineapplehq/hiring-exercises/issues) on by emailing hiring@heywelcome.com

3. Create a new private repository for your exercise and add [Raul @ Welcome](https://github.com/rgil90) and [Dan @ Welcome](https://github.com/thoughtpunch) as private collaborators

4. When complete send a link to the repository and any special instructions to hiring@heywelcome.com

5. Sit back and relax. We'll review your submission and get back to you within 48 hours :smiley:
